## Land Surface Temperature 0.0.1 Release Notes
Release Date: MONTH DAY, YEAR

This project contains application source code for producgin Land Surface Temperature products.  It currently only supports Landsat 5-7, as prototype output products that have not been validated.  Algorithms for specific sensors, where warranted, are located in sensor specific sub-directories.  See the sensor specific sub-directories for more details and usage examples.


This project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project. For questions regarding this source code, please contact the Landsat Contact Us page and specify USGS CDR/ECV in the "Regarding" section. https://landsat.usgs.gov/contactus.php 

### Downloads
Land Surface Temperature source code
```
    git clone https://github.com/USGS-EROS/espa-land-surface-temperature.git
```

See git tag [land-surface-temperature_v0.0.1]

### Installation
  * Install dependent libraries: ESPA product formatter (https://github.com/USGS-EROS/espa-product-formatter)
  * Set up environment variables: Can create an environment shell file or add the following to your bash shell.  For C shell, use 'setenv VAR "directory"'.
```
    export PREFIX="path_to_directory_for_build_data"
```

  * Download: (from Github USGS-EROS land-surface-temperature project) and install source files.

  * Build: The following build will create an executable file under $PREFIX/bin: lst (tested in Linux with the gcc compiler). It will also copy the Python scripts for running Land Surface Temperature the $PREFIX/bin directory.

    - All sensor applications can be built and installed from the top-level directory, or at the users choice only a single individual sensors applications could be built and installed.

    - Available sensor options are:

    l5-7_lst

    - To build all sensor applications.

    make all

    - To install all sensor applications.

    make install

    - To build a single sensor application

    make <sensor>

    - To install a single sensor application

   make <sensor>-install

### Dependencies
  * ESPA raw binary and ESPA common libraries from ESPA product formatter and associated dependencies
  * XML2 library

### Data Preprocessing
This version of the spectral indices application requires the input Landsat products to be in the ESPA internal file format.

### Data Postprocessing
After compiling the ESPA product formatter raw\_binary libraries and tools, the convert\_espa\_to\_gtif and convert\_espa\_to\_hdf command-line tools can be used to convert the ESPA internal file format to HDF or GeoTIFF.  Otherwise the data will remain in the ESPA internal file format, which includes each band in the ENVI file format (i.e. raw binary file with associated ENVI header file) and an overall XML metadata file.

### Associated Scripts
A python script exists in the scripts directory to assist in running the Land Surface Temperature applications.  land\_surface\_temperature.py grabs the user-specified options and generates the desired Land Surface Temperature product by calling the lst executable.
